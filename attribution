Movie Review Data
This page is a distribution site for movie-review data for use in sentiment-analysis experiments. Available are collections of movie-review documents labeled with respect to their overall sentiment polarity (positive or negative) or subjective rating (e.g., "two and a half stars") and sentences labeled with respect to their subjectivity status (subjective or objective) or polarity. These data sets were introduced in the following papers:

    Bo Pang, Lillian Lee, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan, Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning Techniques, Proceedings of EMNLP 2002.
    Bo Pang and Lillian Lee, A Sentimental Education: Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity Summarization Based on Minimum Cuts, Proceedings of ACL 2004.
    Bo Pang and Lillian Lee, Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales, Proceedings of ACL 2005.

Until April 2012 (but no longer), we maintained a list for of other papers using our data the purposes of facilitating comparison of results.

# I used polarity_html.zip:

Pool of 27886 unprocessed html files (81.1Mb) from which the polarity dataset v2.0 was derived. (This file is identical to movie.zip from data release v1.0.)
